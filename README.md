## Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

# Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis is to conduct a Database analysis for Pewlett Hackard with detailed information on the number of future retirees from all departments currently working at the company to be able to prepare a plan to hire new staff and also to prepare a mentorship initiative. We analysised through the entire workforce database and filtered out employees born between the year 1952 - 1955, and who has been loyal to this company since 1985 and 1988.

# Results
* In the following image is the ERD used to visualize the relationship between the data sources and the structure of the company's employee plan to facilitate the analysis. Creating this first allows us to see the Primary Keys, and how the Database is all connected.

# Summary
Currently, at Pewlett Hackard, 64% of their employees will be preparing for retirment or changing positions to be mentorships. Meaning sooner than later, the hiring process will increase heavily. Since a significant amount of future retirees hold Senior positions the mentorship program should provide a buffer for the extensive expertise that will be leaving the company shortly.
